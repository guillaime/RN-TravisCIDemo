[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/guillaime/RN-TravisCIDemo.svg?token=HpjgqrdLExH9HLfTcadL&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/guillaime/RN-TravisCIDemo)

Simple project made to show the functionalities of deploying a React Native app from a single pull request to an app in the App Store or Google Play Console. This by implementing TravisCI and Fastlane. Besides these 2 tools, I also used Fabric to add Crashlytics.

## Scripts
Currently implemented scripts:

* UnitTests & ESLint
* Deploy to Google Play Console
