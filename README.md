## Information
Simple project made to show the functionalities of deploying a React Native app from a single pull request to an app in the App Store or Google Play Console. This by implementing TravisCI and Fastlane. Besides these 2 tools, I also used Fabric to add Crashlytics.

## Scripts
Currently implemented scripts:

* UnitTests & ESLint
* Deploy to Google Play Console

Internal test app is available for download at the following link:
